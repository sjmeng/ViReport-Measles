\section{Input Dataset}
The analysis was conducted on a dataset containing 78 sequences. The average sequence length was 15673.474, with a standard deviation of 1049.887. The earliest sample date was 1989-01-01, the median sample date was 2009-08-09, and the most recent sample date was 2018-10-01.

\section{Preprocessed Dataset}
The input dataset was preprocessed such that sequences were given safe names: non-letters/digits in sequence IDs were converted to underscores. After preprocessing, the dataset contained 78 sequences. The average sequence length was 15673.474, with a standard deviation of 1049.887. The earliest sample date was 1989-01-01, the median sample date was 2009-08-09, and the most recent sample date was 2018-10-01.

\section{Multiple Sequence Alignment}
Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT (Katoh \& Standley, 2013) in automatic mode. There were 16741 positions (12612 invariant) and 74 unique sequences in the multiple sequence alignment. Pairwise distances were computed from the multiple sequence alignment using the tn93 tool of HIV-TRACE (Pond et al., 2018). The average pairwise sequence distance was 0.0447, with a standard deviation of 0.0237.

Across the positions of the multiple sequence alignment, the minimum coverage was 0.0128, the maximum coverage was 1, and the average coverage was 0.936, with a standard deviation of 0.221.

 Across the positions of the multiple sequence alignment that had non-zero Shannon entropy, the minimum Shannon entropy was 0.099, the maximum Shannon entropy was 1.569, and the average Shannon entropy was 0.399, with a standard deviation of 0.325.

\section{Phylogenetic Inference}
A maximum-likelihood phylogeny was inferred using IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al., 2015) in ModelFinder Plus mode (Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017). The inferred phylogeny was MinVar-rooted using FastRoot (Mai et al., 2017).

\end{figure}

Pairwise distances were computed from the phylogeny using TreeSwift (Moshiri, 2020). The maximum pairwise phylogenetic distance (i.e., tree diameter) was 0.0949, and the average pairwise phylogenetic distance was 0.0497, with a standard deviation of 0.0272.
